        <h1>Brief</h1>
        <div class='desc-box'>
          <p>Our aim was to build the new <strong>Hotel Booking application</strong> based on <strong>Hotel API</strong>. The team consisted of one back-end and one front-end (that was me) developer, and of course we had contact with Product Owner. I had <strong>some experience</strong> in building UX for Hotel Booking applications and we as company have <strong>some data</strong> based on our current working in production application. So we quite well knew what we are going to do, had some statistics what works and what not, but we also wanted to add some new, fresh features to <strong>get ahead of the competition</strong>.</p>

        <h1>Technology</h1>
        <div class='desc-box'>
          <p>Our current Hotel IBE (Internet Booking Engine) was build few years ago with redesign more than a two years ago. It was based on ASP.NET framework. In the new IBE we decided to use <strong>Rails as our backend framework</strong> together with a lot of <strong>helpfull frontend tools</strong> provided right out of the box: SASS (in fact I prefer SCSS syntax) with Compass, HAML and CoffeeScript with AssetPipeline. Next we decided to use jQuery (nothing special here), backbone.js (to keep client&#8217;s code organized) together with Handlebars as our <strong>client&#8217;s side templating engine</strong>. We also use Jasmine <strong>to test</strong> our front-end code.</p>

        <h1>Phase 1. Planning</h1>
        <div class='img-box'>

        </div>
        <div class='desc-box'>
          <p>We would like to take what worked in our current IBE and change what not. I made a <strong>comprehensive analysis</strong> of our competition&#8217;s apps (total of 11) like <a href='http://booking.com'>booking.com</a> or <a href='http://agoda.de'>agoda.de</a>. Most of them had similar features and layouts but there were also quite innovative solutions like <a href='http://www.google.com/hotelfinder/'>Google Hotel Finder</a> or <a href='http://www.hipmunk.com/hotels'>hipmunk.com</a>. We also knew, that despite the innovation, our <strong>target users</strong> (mainly Germans) are quite used to well known solutions for them. So we need to <strong>find a balance</strong>. We would like to push our users a bit forward but in the way they would still feel comfortable with our app.</p>
          
          <p>So I started <strong>sketching and noting</strong> all ideas for features and solutions, all that could be helpfull in the future of our project. We had the basic idea, we already knew the flow and how many steps we need to prepare for user to finish its task with our app. The <strong>two main challenges</strong> were Hotels Page, with list of all available hotels, and Hotel Page, with all the details of selected hotel and room selection.</p>

        <h1>Phase 2. Prototyping</h1>
        <article>
          <div class='desc-box'>
            <p>It was time to <strong>get our hands dirty</strong> with some coding. The first page of the flow was Start Page, consisting of search form, as minimal as possible. I pushed on removing all <strong>unnecessary fields</strong> because our goal here was to take users on Hotels Page as quick as possible.</p>
            
            <p>As we were in prototyping phase I did <strong>minimal</strong> styling and basic layout, just to show functions of the elements.</p>

          </div>
          <div class='desc-box'>
            <p>The second page (Hotels Page) was <strong>huge challenge</strong> as we had a lot of features to present here. The main aim of users on this page was to find best hotel for them, that fulfills all their criteria. I think that the best solution (theoretical) would be to display only one hotel, the one that <strong>user would be happy</strong> with, but to achieve this we would need to know all user needs and preferences. Ok, back to the point, we started with displaying list of available hotels, then added some sorting and filtering posibilities. Each hotel has a lot of attributes by which it could be categorized like rating, special deals, facilities, location etc. And we also need to display all of them for the users to decide. The important part of this page was <strong>map with the hotels</strong> but I will get back to it later. From the technical point of view, page is mainly rendered on the client&#8217;s side to make the <strong>interaction</strong> more smooth.</p>

          <div class='desc-box'>
            <p>The third page (Hotel page) was fully redesigned. I came to <strong>quite oposite idea</strong> than in our current IBE and in most of competition. Instead of displaying a lot of hotel&#8217;s detailed information in tabs, let&#8217;s display them one after the other in one long page and let&#8217;s add some <strong>handy page menu</strong> to navigate between the sections. I also redesigned the photo gallery.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Ok, so we had prototypes of our two main challenges, we <strong>had approval</strong> of our Product Owner and some <strong>positive feedback</strong> from people not involved in project (as our low budget UX testing group). Next we decided to add some design, as the following steps were only a checkout process (I know that checkout steps are <strong>important</strong> but we decided to build them after first 3 steps would be ready).</p>

        <h1>Phase 3. Design</h1>
        <div class='desc-box'>
          <p>I am not a graphic designer (rather <strong>CSS3 designer</strong>), and I did a lot of designing for our current IBE, so I <strong>convinced</strong> our Product Owner (and Manager in the same person) that we should involve someone from outside of the company, a well skilled graphic designer with <strong>fresh look</strong> at our application.</p>
          
          <p>So one page after another we prepared beautiful and usable mockups. My cooperation with graphic designer began from specifying all requirements and contents of each page, then in <strong>short iteration</strong> we focused on single elements of pages, <strong>improving</strong> them till I was fully satisfied.</p>

        <div class='desc-box'>
          <p>We already had a lot of <strong>working code</strong> after prototyping phase. And we did not have much time <strong>till deadline</strong>. So while waiting for new designs from graphic designer, I was implementing the already accepted ones, <strong>changing prototypes into final product</strong>.</p>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <div class='desc-box'>
          <p>The project took <strong>about 3 months</strong>. We designed some more features than we were able to implement during that period, mainly because of technical resons (like Hotel API had not been supporting the feature yet). We left them for future iterations but <strong>the main flow was finished</strong>. We could switch our first users to new IBE and start <strong>Phase 5: Testing</strong>.</p>

              <p>I am enthusiastic web developer, who can never stop exploring news in web-world. I am continually expand my skills and I am never afraid of new technologies. My everyday work consist of getting to know the problem, finding solution, building prototypes and then programming web front-end. I use <em>HTML5</em> and all <em>CSS3</em> power supported by <em>JavaScript</em> magic to develop nice looking, usable and human friendly interfaces. I especially fond of Ruby world because of a lot nice tools which make my work easier, like <em>HAML, SASS</em> and <em>CoffeeScript</em>. I am also <em>startups</em> and agile project management fan.</p>
